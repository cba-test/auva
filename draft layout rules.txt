Layout is defined by rules or script of sorts
Landscape
Three main panels
1. Artwork - left 50% wof window, upper 88% of window
2. Control - right 50% of window, upper 88% of window
3. Bar - full width of window, bottom 12% of window

1080 - 150 = 930

Artwork contains AlbumArtArea panel
852 art
930 - 852 = 78/2 = 39px margin
so margins are set using vertical
artwork size is set, how?
hortizontal; 1920/2=960 so 39px margin is roughly 4%
vertical; 930 means 39px margins is roughly 4.2%

so.. AlbumArtArea height/width is set as 92% (100% minus two margins of 4% each) of Artwork panel width or height, whichever is smaller.

AlbumArtArea is treated as a square - making non-square AlbumArt images fit is a seperate issue.

EDIT: not happy with vertical alignment of albumArtArea when using width to define margin - would prefer albumArtArea to be vertically centred

So, firstly, defined Area class

Area:
 top - int
 left - int
 width - int
 height - int

now, set Landscape areas
 Bar.left = 0
 Bar.width = window.width
 Bar.height = int(window.height * 0.88) 
 Bar.top = window.height - Bar.height

 Artwork.top = 0
 Artwork.left = 0
 Artwork.width = int(window.width / 2)
 Artwork.height = Bar.top

 Control.top = 0
 Control.left = window.width - Artwork.width
 Control.width = Artwork.width
 Control.height = Bar.top

 if Artwork.width > Artwork.height:
  AlbumArtMargin = int(Artwork.height * 0.04)
  AlbumArtSize = int(Artwork.height * 0.92)

  AlbumArtArea.top = AlbumArtMargin
  AlbumArtArea.left = AlbumArtMargin
  AlbumArtArea.width = AlbumArtSize
  AlbumArtArea.height = AlbumArtSize
 else:
  # insert method for vertically centred albumArtArea
  AlbumArtMargin = int(Artwork.width * 0.04)
  AlbumArtSize = int(Artwork.width * 0.92)

  AlbumArtArea.left = AlbumArtMargin
  AlbumArtArea.width = AlbumArtSize
  AlbumArtArea.height = AlbumArtSize
  AlbumArtArea.top = int((Artwork.height - AlbumArtArea.width) / 2)

Advanced; use fixed width to allow Control to "overlap" Art.
For this to work, I need a method to figure out the minimum width that can be applied to Art and Control before overlap method is used. Overlap method "slides" Control area over Art area, which is visually achieved by lowering the opacity of the AlbumArtArea until complete overlap puts opacity at 0%.

For this method to work, I believe there needs to be a relationship between the standard 16:9 ratio and the albumart.

ie. if we assume a standard 16:9 window with square artwork, the overlap method will start if the width of the window is reduced from the default value.

correction: 1280x800 is 16:10 and looks fine, so the base ratio does not need to be 16:9. Anything lower (width-wise) than 3:2 seems like it wants the overlap effect.

This means the fixed minimum width is window.height * 3 / 2. Height must be used because it is "fixed" against width.

If overlap is required;
fixed width = window.height * 3 / 2
ControlArea width = fixed width
opacity is set against a scale defined as 0 (window.width = fixed width or total overlap) and 100 (?)

EDIT: scratch that. ratio to be checked should be the artArea, not the window
